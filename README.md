# GQSAT 

Can Q-learning with Graph Networks learn a Generalizable Branching Heuristic for a SAT solver?

* I will first go over the commands used to install all the necessary modules. 

* Then I will go over how to train and test using GQSAT, and changes I made to the original code for my experiments. 

* Lastly, I will describe what is included in some of the files I added to the repo.


PLEASE RUN EVERYTHING ON UBUNTU!!

## How to add metadata for evaluation
This will add a METADATA file that is necessary for your validation problems in training and your testing problems when testing
* First download your dataset from https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html
* Unzip the dataset and partition the ``*/cnf`` files into training, validation, and/or testing folders
* Run the command below once for your validation folder (if any) and once for your testing folder (if any)
```python3 add_metadata.py --eval-problems-paths <path_to_folder_with_cnf>```

## How to train
This will train GQSAT using your training problems and validate using your validation problems
* First open train.sh in a text editor
* Replace the path in ``--train-problems-paths ./data/uf20-91/train1Problem \`` with the path to your training folder
* Replace the path in ``--eval-problems-paths ./data/uf20-91/validation \`` with the path to your validation folder
```./train.sh```

## How to evaluate 
This will run the learned branching heuristic on your test problems
* First open evaluate.sh in a text editor
* Replace the path in ``--eval-problems-paths ./data/uf250-1065/test \`` with the path to your test folder
* Replace the path in ``--model-dir ./runs/uf20-91-1/ \`` with the path to the folder generated by your training step
* Replace the file in ``--model-checkpoint model_10000.chkp \`` with the model you want to use (I evaluated all the models on the validation problems and chose the one with the highest median_relative_score and then the highest mean_relative_score if there was a tie)
```./evaluate.sh```

## How to change maximum (model) decisions

* Open evaluate.sh in a text editor
* Change then number in ``--test_time_max_decisions_allowed 500 \`` to the number of maximum decisions you want to allocate to GQSAT

## How to change output format of evaluate.sh
We only want to obtain the MRIR values and mean_relative_score values (iteration improvement) for our experimental results.
* Open ``utils.py`` from the gqsat folder
* comment out or change the print statements depending on what you want to output during the evaluation of each problem
* Open ``evaluation.py`` 
* comment out or change the print statements depending on what you want to output and the end of evaluation

## Output evaluate.sh to a file
To make working with the data easier, you may want to pipe the output of evaluate.sh to a file.
* Open ``evaluate.sh``
* Add a line like ``>> ./data/uf250-1065/uf250-1065-gqsat-train1.tsv`` specifying the folder and file to put your output in.
